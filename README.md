## About LinkShortener in PHP (Laravel)

This LinkShortener is a web application based on Laravel (PHP) that can shorten any long URL. You can use it like bitly. But, It is self hosted. Currently, The initial version has the following features:

- Create ShortLink of Any Long URLs
- View Shortlinks

More Features will come later. I already have a big project of LinkShortener. But, I will be updating this repository by modifying something for security & private reasons.

## How to Run this Project
Running this project is very easy. To do it, you can follow these steps.

- Make Sure You Have Installed Composer on Your System
- Then, Download this project and open it with any editor.
- Now, type composer update in the terminal and hit enter. If your editor doesn't have built in terminal, you can use default terminal of your OS.
- Rename the .env.example to .env and put your database details here.
- Also define your APP_URL there.
- Then run this command "php artisan migrate" and then, this one "php artisan db:seed"
- Now, You can run your project from local host. However, You also can use this command "php artisan serv" to test this project.
- The default username is "hasib" and password is "123456". Use this credential to login and create shortlink

You can modify/customize this project. I hope this project will help to understand how to build a custom link shortening application with Laravel.
